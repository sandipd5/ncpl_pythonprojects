## Key Concepts and Tasks

### **1. Python Functions**
- Functions with varying numbers of parameters and return types.
- Exploring function scope and variable accessibility.
- Using default argument values.
- Writing recursive functions.
- Documenting with docstrings.

### **2. Lambda Functions**
- Simple lambda functions for various operations.
- Utilizing lambda functions with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- Comparing lambda functions to regular functions.

### **3. NumPy**
- Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays.
- Performing arithmetic operations on arrays.
- Using indexing and slicing to access elements.
- Manipulating arrays with functions like `reshape`, `transpose`, and `concatenate`.
- Generating random numbers with NumPy.

### **4. Pandas**
- Creating Pandas Series and DataFrames.
- Loading data from CSV and Excel files.
- Cleaning and manipulating data.
- Analyzing data with pivot tables and group operations.

### **5. Conditional Logic**
- Writing `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements.
- Creating complex conditional expressions.
- Implementing nested `if` statements.

### **6. Loops**
- Iterating sequences with `for` loops.
- Using `while` loops for indefinite iteration.
- Implementing nested loops.
- Controlling loop flow with `break` and `continue`.

### **7. Data Structures**
- Creating and manipulating lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
- Understanding differences and use cases for each data structure.
- Exploring built-in methods for efficient operations.

### **8. Operators**
- Demonstrating arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
- Understanding operator precedence and applying it in expressions.

### **9. Reading CSV Files**
- Loading CSV data into Pandas DataFrames.
- Handling missing values and cleaning data.
- Exploring various CSV reading parameters.

### **10. Python String Methods**
- Manipulating strings with built-in methods.
- Operations like concatenation, slicing, and finding substrings.
- Converting case formats and removing whitespace.
